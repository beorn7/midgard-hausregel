# Midgard-Hausregel

House rules for the Midgard RPG (in German).

Only interesting if you are both a German speaker and an old-school
pen&paper RPGer.

Midgard is the oldest RPG system in German language.
See http://midgard-online.de/.

These are the house rules I am using.
See http://rabenste.in/kwiki for results.
